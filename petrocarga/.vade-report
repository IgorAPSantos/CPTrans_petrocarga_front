Implemented Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js App Router Project

## Changes Made:

### 1. Installed @vercel/analytics Package
- Added `@vercel/analytics` package to project dependencies using npm
- Updated package.json and package-lock.json with the new dependency

### 2. Modified app/layout.tsx
- Imported the Analytics component from '@vercel/analytics/next'
- Added the <Analytics /> component inside the <body> tag, placed after the closing </AuthProvider> tag
- The component is properly positioned to track page views across the entire application

## Files Modified:
- `/app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component
- `/package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- `/package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependency resolution

## Implementation Details:

The Analytics component was added to the root layout file following Next.js App Router best practices:
- Import: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next';`
- Placement: Inside the <body> tag, after all content providers and wrappers
- This ensures analytics tracking is active across all routes in the application

## Verification:

✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
✅ Linter ran with no new errors introduced
✅ The layout file structure is preserved, maintaining all existing functionality
✅ All lock files have been updated to ensure dependency consistency

## Notes:

- The project uses npm as the package manager (identified by package-lock.json)
- This is an App Router project using TypeScript
- The Analytics component will automatically track page views when the app is deployed to Vercel
- No additional configuration is required; analytics will work out of the box on Vercel deployments
